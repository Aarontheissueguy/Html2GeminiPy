# Html2Gemini
This simple python programm allows you to convert html to fully usable gmi files.
Using it is fairly simple. install md2gemini and markdownify with pip before you start.
Now place your entire site in the input folder (the script will filter it for html files). Run main.py with python 3 and wait untill it is done. You will now find your .gmi files in the output/gemini folder. You can simply run a server with those files and everything should work. This is script is intended to be used on html and text heavy sites. PHP files will not be converted. Codeblocks are somewhat buggy from time to time.
